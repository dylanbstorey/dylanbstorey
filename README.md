# Hey, I'm Dylan

I build tools and teams. Most of my work lives at [colliery-io](https://github.com/colliery-io) where I'm building systems that help developers and AI agents work better.

## Active projects

**Developer tools & automation**
- [angreal](https://github.com/angreal/angreal) — Task automation and project scaffolding (Rust core, Python API)
- [crt](https://github.com/colliery-io/crt) — A ridiculous terminal

**Orchestration & workflows**
- [brokkr](https://github.com/colliery-io/brokkr) — Multi-cluster Kubernetes orchestration with pull-based, API-first design
- [cloacina](https://github.com/colliery-io/cloacina) — Embedded workflow engine with retries, state persistence, and dependency resolution

**Data & AI**
- [graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite) — SQLite extension adding graph database capabilities with Cypher queries
- [metis](https://github.com/colliery-io/metis) — Work management for AI agents via MCP server integration

**Consumer software**
- [mimir](https://github.com/mimir-dm/mimir) — Desktop companion for D&D 5e game masters (Tauri + Vue + Rust)

I write a lot of Rust these days. Always happy to collaborate on interesting infrastructure problems.
